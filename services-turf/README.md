Turf for Java is a [spatial analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis) library written for Java SE and Android applications. It is ported from the [Turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/) library.

Turf for Java is **experimental** and its public API is subject to change. Please use with care and open issues for any problems you see or missing features that should be added.
