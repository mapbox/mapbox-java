# Mapbox Java CLI

This is a wrapper on top of our mapbox-java services. This was made to be a fast
debugging and testing tool, that can be used to verify new and old json contracts.

If you'd like to add a feature, add an issue to the mapbox-java repository
and we can help. Also, pull requests are always welcome!
