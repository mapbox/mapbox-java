### RELEASE_VERSION_NUMBER-alpha.1 pre-release checklist 

- [ ] Create a new branch off of `master`.
- [ ] Update the SNAPSHOT version in this repo's `README.md` file
- [ ] Update this repo's `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Change version name to `RELEASE_VERSION_NUMBER-alpha.1` in this repo's `gradle.properties` (make sure to remove `-SNAPSHOT`)
- [ ] [Create a new Github release](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/releases/new) with a release title of `Mapbox Java SDK vRELEASE_VERSION_NUMBER-alpha.1`, a tag version of `vRELEASE_VERSION_NUMBER-alpha.1`, targeting the release branch you made above in step #1, and checking the `This is a pre-release` box. This will publish artifacts to Bintray.

After the tag is created, the CI build starts automatically at https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/mapbox-java and our CircleCI circle.yml file instructs CircleCI to push the artifact to Bintray.

Once CircleCI successfully pushes the artifact files to Bintray, log into Bintray with the Mapbox credentials. Once you're signed in, visit this release numbers's `Files` page for each of the Java SDK modules:

- https://bintray.com/mapbox/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-turf#files/com/mapbox/mapboxsdk/mapbox-sdk-turf

- https://bintray.com/mapbox/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-geojson#files/com/mapbox/mapboxsdk/mapbox-sdk-geojson

- https://bintray.com/mapbox/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-services#files/com/mapbox/mapboxsdk/mapbox-sdk-services

- https://bintray.com/mapbox/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-core#files/com/mapbox/mapboxsdk/mapbox-sdk-core

Verify the attached files for each module, especially the POM which contains the artifact's dependencies. Go to the `Maven Central` tab and click the `Sync` button to sync the artifact with the repository.

- [ ] Change version name back to having `-SNAPSHOT` at the end
