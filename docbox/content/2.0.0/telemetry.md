## Telemetry

Mapbox SDKs collect anonymous data about the map and device location to continuously update and improve your maps. For Android, it is designed to be lightweight and minimize impact on performance and battery life. If you are using our maps SDK, telemetry's already included in your project. In other cases you might want to use our locationEngine or permissionManager inside your project. The Telemetry module has no dependencies on any of the other Mapbox-Java modules and only depends on having the Android API plugin inside your project.
