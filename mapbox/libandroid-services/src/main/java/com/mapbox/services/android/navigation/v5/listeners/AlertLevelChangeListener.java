 * Listening in to the alertLevelChange is useful for correctly getting the timing of user notifications while the user

 * current step they are on. The alert thresholds can be adjusted within the constants file while developing and are
 * based on time (in seconds) till the user reaches the next maneuver.
 * <p>
 * This is an experimental API. Experimental APIs are quickly evolving and might change or be removed in minor versions.
